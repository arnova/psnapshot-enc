Description
-----------
psnapshot-enc is a script to create (incremental) snapshots (backups) of e.g.
your NAS to an offsite location. The script is inspired by rsnapshot (and
some articles I've read on the internet) with the exception that it pushes
the backups from the client to the server using ssh + rsync, rather than
pulling backups from the server side (like rsnapshot). Like rsnapshot,
psnapshot-enc uses hardlinks to create incremental backups which allows you 
to easily access files in old backups + (old) backups can be easily purged.
Furthermore it uses client side encryption (using encfs) to allow backups to
untrusted servers. The script is still under development (beta) but it's
already working quite well (for me). Everyone is encouraged to test it and
report back.


Requirements
------------
- rsync
- ssh
- sshfs
- encfs
- (root) POSIX shell


Compatible/tested systems
-------------------------
- Any Linux operating systems meeting the above requirements
- "ZyXEL NSA325v2" NAS (running FFP) and "Netgear ReadyNAS 102". Although
  untested, it should probably also work on other Linux based NAS systems
  with (root) shell access.
