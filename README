psnapshot-enc is a script to create (incremental) snapshots (backups) of e.g.
your NAS to an offsite location. The script is inspired by rsnapshot (and
some articles I've read on the internet) with the exception that it pushes
the backups from the client to the server using ssh + rsync, rather than
pulling backups from the server side (like rsnapshot). However, like
rsnapshot, psnapshot-enc uses hardlinks to create incremental backups which
allows you to easily access files in old backups + (old) backups can be
easily purged. Furthermore it uses client side encryption (using encfs) to
allow backup to untrusted servers. The script is still under development
(beta) but it's already working quite well (for me). Everyone is encouraged
to test it and report back.
